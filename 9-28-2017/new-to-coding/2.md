##2. Elementary exercises

Elementary Exercises, to be done at play.golang.org. Help students with exercises so they can run something tangible, at least one exercise before going over programming concepts. Seeing a program run builds confidence,


Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.


Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := "xyz"
	
	fmt.Println("Hello ", name)
}
```


Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := "alice"
	
	if name == "alice" || name == "bob" {
		fmt.Println("Hello ", name)
	}
}
```


Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var n = 5
	var sum int

	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		sum = sum + i
	}

	fmt.Printf("Sum of n (%d) = %d", n, sum)
}
```
